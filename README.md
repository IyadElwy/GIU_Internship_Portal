### Users and Components:



#### 2.1 Users
Different types of users can use the GIU Internship Portal system. Users are either: Student, Employer,
Admin, Faculty Representative, Career office Coordinator and Academic Advisor. Any user can view, and
search any information related to the internships posted on the system. A user has a username, password,
ID and email.



#### 2.1.1 Student
Any GIU student can register on the portal. A student should provide the following information: full
name (first name, middle name and last name), ID, GIU email, birth date, age, semester, faculty, major,
GPA, address and mobile number(s). After registration, an auto generated password should be set to each
student and sent to their GIU email. The student may upload his/her CV and cover letter, or use the
CV builder to create a professional cohesive resume. A student can apply to different internships. After
applying for an internship, the student can keep track for his/her application status (pending, shortlisted,
rejected or hired).



#### 2.1.2 Employer
To register on the system, the employer needs to provide the following information: company name,
address, phone number, fax number, email, their website, type of business: startup (national or multinational), company (national, multinational or public), government entity, etc., establishment year, country
of origin, industry, current number of employees and the products/services provided by the business. Each
company has to indicate a contact person who will coordinate with the GIU career office any recruitment
related activities. Additionally, each company has an HR director. An HR director has a name and email
that should be also saved on the system. After registration, an auto generated password should be set to
the employer and sent to the contact person’s email. The profile will be then reviewed by an admin. An
employer is only allowed to post job offers when their profile is reviewed and accepted from a GIU career
office admin. After posting a job, the employer is able to view all applicants and update their application
status.


#### 2.1.3 Admin
A GIU career office admin is responsible for reviewing registered employers’ profiles, then update the
profile status (accepted or rejected), with mentioning the reason in case of rejected. Also, before any
job offer is posted on the system, it must first pass by a career office admin. The admin will check the
plausibility of the job, make the job offer post visible to students if accepted, invisible if rejected. The
admin may mention the reason for rejecting this job offer. The system should keep track of the admins
who reviewed the employer profiles or job offers.


#### 2.1.4 Faculty Representative
From every faculty at the GIU, a representative will be selected. A faculty representative has an ID,
name, email and faculty. Approved industrial internships job offers by an admin are not posted till they
are further reviewed by a faculty representative. He/she checks if those industrial internships are relevant
to the faculty or not.



#### 2.1.5 Career Office Coordinator
A career office coordinator can view all the applicants applying for every industrial internship. Then,
he/she filters the applicants and send a list of the potential candidates to the employer to proceed
with the selection process. A career office coordinator assigns an academic advisor to every industrial
internship.



#### 2.1.6 Academic Advisor
After a student is accepted in an industrial internship, he/she will be monitored by an academic advisor
to ensure that students are having the utmost experience out of those internships. The academic advisor
views and evaluates the progress reports of his/her students. Every academic advisor has an ID, name,
email and faculty.



#### 2.2 Job
A registered employer can offer several job opportunities. Every job offer has a title, description, department, start/end dates, duration, application deadline, number of available internships for this vacancy,
allowed faculty(s), salary range (mention if it’s unpaid), qualifications, required semester(s), location (remote, hybrid, etc.). The application step is either through a provided online application link or through
a provided email. A job can be full time, part time, project based, freelance, summer internship or industrial internship. An industrial internship will not be posted unless it’s reviewed and accepted by the
Industrial Internships Committee (a career office admin and a faculty representative). In case of a part
time job, work day(s) should be provided.


#### 2.3 CV Builder
A registered student can create a resume using the CV Builder tool. It will automatically retrieve some
of the student’s information provided during the registration process (name, GIU mail, GPA, semester,
faculty, major). Additional information will be required from the student such as: personal mail, education, extracurricular activities, skills (technical, language), achievements honors, LinkedIn Profile Link,
Behance/Github Links. The system should ensure that whenever the student updates any information
used in the CV builder, the resume will be updated.



#### 2.4 Progress Report
The student should fill progress reports during the industrial internship. A progress report shows the
student’s progress state (numeric). Also, it has a description, date, and evaluation.



#### 2.5 Contact Person
A contact person is an employee who is in charge of coordinating the whole process with the GIU career
office on behalf of his/her esteemed organization. A contact person has a name, job title, email, mobile
number(s) and fax.
